# What is this app about?
  This app allows the users to create and store travel itenaries which can be viewed at one place.
  
# What made me choose this idea?
I love travelling and love being organzied.I often find myself struggling to search through all the travel related information in my email which makes my life   difficult.In order to solve the problem, I chose to develop this feature where I can create and store all the information and view my itenaries in one place.
  
# Reason for the project: 
This project was built as a requirment to completing the final phase of our software engineering course at Flatiron school (class of 09/21). The main aim is to apply and showcase the knowledge and skills I have acquired from the beginning of our bootcamp up to this point. These skills are demonstrated with the use of JavaScript and React functional components - this encompasses using React states to manage and manipulate dynamically changing events on the DOM, setting and using controlled forms and persisting data to a backend server. I also demostrated the skill of building a server side application to manage and communicate with  frontend using ruby on rails to manage a PostgreSQL database, define restful and non-restful routes, manage authentication and authorizations and validating data received from our frontend. Finally, we demostrated our knowledge and skill with CSS to design my web application.
  
# How to start the app?

# App Description
Gallivanter App is designed to log in or signup as a user. Once the account is created, the user will have access to creating trip itineraries by navigating to the trip planner section. Once the trip itineraries are created, it is available to view. Trip itineraries can be deleted as well. Signed-in users can also view various tourist destinations and attractions nearby. The search feature helps the user to search for a specific destination. With the help of sorting, "things to do " can be sorted into attractions and activities. Users can also view the Bucket list section that has all the favorites added by the user. In the end, the user can also delete the account.

# Goals for more features
