# What is this app about?
  This app allows the users to create and store travel itenaries which can be viewed at one place.
  
# What made me choose this idea?
I love travelling and love being organzied.I often find myself struggling to search through all the travel related information in my email which makes my life   difficult.In order to solve the problem, I chose to develop this feature where I can create and store all the information and view my itenaries in one place.
  
# Reason for the project: 
This project was built as a requirment to completing the final phase of our software engineering course at Flatiron school (class of 09/21). The main aim is to apply and showcase the knowledge and skills I have acquired from the beginning of our bootcamp up to this point. These skills are demonstrated with the use of JavaScript and React functional components - this encompasses using React states to manage and manipulate dynamically changing events on the DOM, setting and using controlled forms and persisting data to a backend server. I also demostrated the skill of building a server side application to manage and communicate with  frontend using ruby on rails to manage a PostgreSQL database, define restful and non-restful routes, manage authentication and authorizations and validating data received from our frontend. Finally, we demostrated our knowledge and skill with CSS to design my web application.
  
# How to start the app?
